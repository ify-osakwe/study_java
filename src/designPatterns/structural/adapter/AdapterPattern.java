/**
 * <p> Adapter design pattern converts an interface of a class
 * into another interface that a client expect. It works as a bridge
 * between two incompatible interfaces, it does the conversion,
 * also known as a "wrapper"
 *
 * <p> Examples of adapter design = java.util.Arrays#asList, java.io.InputStreamReader,
 * java.io.OutputStreamWriter
 *
 * <p>There are 2 types of adapter pattern - object adapter and class adapters.
 * Object adapter relies on one object (the adapting object) containing another
 * (the adapted object) (composition). Class adapter uses multiple inheritance,
 * it is less of a focus and not really implemented in Java
