==> ClimbingStairs.java
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps.
In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

Example 2:
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 45

####################################################################################
==> CoinChange.java
You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an
integer amount representing a total amount of money. Return the fewest number of coins that
you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination
of the coins, return -1. You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

Example 1:
Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1

Example 2:
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1

Example 3:
Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
Output: 0

Constraints:
1 <= coins.length <= 12
1 <= coins[i] <= 2^31 - 1
0 <= amount <= 10^4

####################################################################################
==> LongestIncreasingSubsequence.java

Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.
A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements
without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4

Example 3:
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1

####################################################################################
==> LongestCommonSubsequence.java

Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.
If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters
(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

Example 1:
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

Example 2:
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

Example 3:
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.

Constraints:
1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000
text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.

####################################################################################
==> WordBreak.java

Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented
into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.
Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

Example 1:
Input: s = "leetcode",
wordDict = ["leet","code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".

Example 2:
Input: s = "applepenapple",
wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.

Example 3:
Input: s = "catsandog",
wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
Output: false

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 300
1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000
1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 20
s and wordDict[i] consist of only lowercase English letters.
All the strings of wordDict are unique.

####################################################################################
==> CombinationSum.java

Given an array of distinct integers nums and a target integer target,
return the number of possible combinations that add up to target.
The test cases are generated so that the answer can fit in a 32-bit integer.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3], target = 4
Output: 7
Explanation:
The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)
Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [9], target = 3
Output: 0

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 200
1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
All the elements of nums are unique.
1 <= target <= 1000

==> HouseRobber.java

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street.
Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you
from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected
and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house,
return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 100
0 <= nums[i] <= 400

####################################################################################
==> HouseRobberII.java

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street.
Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle.
That means the first house is the neighbour of the last one. Meanwhile,
adjacent houses have a security system connected, and it will automatically contact the police
if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house,
return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
because they are adjacent houses.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 3

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 100
0 <= nums[i] <= 1000

####################################################################################
==> DecodeWays.java

A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:
'A' -> "1"
'B' -> "2"
...
'Z' -> "26"

However, while decoding the message, you realize that there are many different ways you can
decode the message because some codes are contained in other codes ("2" and "5" vs "25").

For example, "11106" can be mapped into:
"AAJF" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)
"KJF" with the grouping (11 10 6)
The grouping (1, 11, 06) is invalid because "06" is not a valid code (only "6" is valid).

Note: there may be strings that are impossible to decode.
Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it.
If the entire string cannot be decoded in any valid way, return 0.
The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

Example 1:
Input: s = "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: "12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).

Example 2:
Input: s = "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: "226" could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).

Example 3:
Input: s = "06"
Output: 0
Explanation: "06" cannot be mapped to "F" because of the leading zero ("6" is different from "06").

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 100
s contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).
