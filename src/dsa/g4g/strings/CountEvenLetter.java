/*
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase english letters. Your task is to count
how many distinct characters appear an even number of times in the string.
Input: s = "abacaba"
Output: 2
Explanation: The frequency of a is 4, b is 2 and c is 1 so there are 2 characters with even frequency.
Input: s = "zzacccz"
Output: 0
Explanation:The frequency of z is 3, a is 1 and c is 3 so there are no characters with even frequency.
Constraint: 1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 10^5
