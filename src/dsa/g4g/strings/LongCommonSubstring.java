/*
You are given two strings s1 and s2. Your task is to find the length of the longest
common substring among the given strings.

Input: s1 = "ABCDGH", s2 = "ACDGHR"
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest common substring is "CDGH" with a length of 4.

Input: s1 = "abc", s2 = "acb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest common substrings are "a", "b", "c" all having length 1.

Input: s1 = "YZ", s2 = "yz"
Output: 0

Constraints:
1 <= s1.size(), s2.size() <= 10^3
Both strings may contain upper and lower case alphabets.
